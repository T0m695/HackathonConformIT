89,1028,"On March 18, 2024, at 10:15 PM during evening shift, Abdul Rahman, Machine Operator on Injection Molding Line C (UNIT-003), discovered that the hydraulic pressure gauge on the medical component injection molding machine had failed. The analog gauge display showed erratic readings (fluctuating between 0 and 350 bar), making it impossible to monitor proper injection pressure for the sterile medical device housings in production. Abdul attempted to calibrate the gauge manually using a backup portable pressure meter, but this workaround proved unreliable. At approximately 10:42 PM, the machine's hydraulic system experienced a pressure spike to 425 bar (exceeding the 400 bar safety limit) due to undetected calibration drift. The over-pressure event triggered the machine's emergency relief valve, which activated as designed, venting hydraulic fluid into the collection reservoir. However, the relief valve seal had developed micro-cracks from months of exposure to composite resin vapors, causing a slow hydraulic leak that continued throughout the shift. By end of shift at 11:30 PM, approximately 3 liters of hydraulic fluid had accumulated in the containment area. Quality control identified that 47 medical device housings produced during the pressure spike period required full rejection due to dimensional variance exceeding ISO 13485 tolerances. The equipment was taken offline for maintenance and seal replacement.",2022-07-16 09:58:00,2022-07-16 11:13:00,128,EHS,EQUIPMENT_FAILURE

279,1001,"On March 28, 2024 at approximately 1:30 AM during the night shift, a catastrophic equipment failure occurred in the Post-Processing and Heat Treatment facility. The main industrial oven, a 15-year-old model used for curing composite resins, experienced an internal electrical fault within its heating element array. The fault caused an uncontrolled thermal runaway condition, causing internal temperatures to exceed safe operating limits (reached approximately 480°C versus the intended 200°C setpoint). The excessive heat caused thermal stress on the oven's exterior casing and internal structural components, resulting in visible warping of the metal frame and cracking of the insulation. Additionally, the intense heat caused the thermal overload switch to fail, preventing the automatic shutdown mechanism from functioning. The oven's cooling system engaged but could not overcome the thermal event. When night shift supervisor Julien Racine (EMP-00177) and two maintenance technicians arrived to investigate an unusual alarm condition, they discovered the oven exterior was too hot to approach safely (surface temperature approximately 85°C) and the interior was still glowing visibly through observation ports. The equipment was immediately de-energized and isolated using lockout procedures. The oven sustained severe internal damage requiring complete replacement of the heating element assembly and control system, with replacement parts and labor costs exceeding $180,000.

451,1007,"On November 15, 2024, at approximately 2:45 PM during the day shift, a catastrophic failure occurred in Injection Molding Line C's hydraulic pressure system. Production Engineer Sébastien Carrier was conducting routine quality checks near the molding station when the main hydraulic line connecting to the injection cylinder ruptured without warning. High-pressure hydraulic fluid sprayed across the clean room area, coating equipment and the surrounding workspace. The sudden loss of pressure caused the injection platen to drop unexpectedly, though no personnel were directly struck. Carrier immediately activated the emergency stop and notified Maintenance. Technician Luc Girard responded within minutes and isolated the hydraulic system. The rupture was traced to a hairline fracture in the steel tubing that had developed over months due to vibration and inadequate support bracket maintenance. Approximately 40 liters of hydraulic fluid leaked onto the production floor, requiring hazmat containment procedures. The incident halted production for 8 hours while repairs were completed.

452,1168,"On December 3, 2024, at 10:15 AM, an electrical control panel failure occurred in the Central Maintenance Workshop. Maintenance Technician Luc Girard was attempting to troubleshoot a malfunctioning programmable logic controller (PLC) when the 480-volt main distribution panel experienced an internal fault. The primary disconnect switch failed to respond to manual activation, trapping electrical load on the circuit. When Girard attempted to manually reset a circuit breaker, a capacitor bank inside the panel discharged unexpectedly, creating an arc flash that scorched the panel interior and caused visible damage to internal components. The incident triggered an automatic facility-wide power cut-off due to the integrated safety relay system. No personnel were injured due to adequate distance and PPE, but the panel sustained approximately €18,000 in damage to internal wiring, bus bars, and terminal blocks. The facility was without primary electrical power for 6 hours while the panel was inspected, the fault isolated, and temporary power restored.

453,1007,"On December 10, 2024, at 4:20 PM during evening shift transition, a near-miss incident was identified in the Raw Materials Warehouse. Forklift Operator Claude Poirier was moving a pallet stack of raw plastic resin (approximately 1,200 kg) from the receiving dock when he noticed that one of the four pallet feet was not properly seated on the forks. The load was shifted slightly to the left and appeared unstable. Rather than continuing to the storage location, Poirier immediately lowered the load to the ground at the current position. Material Handler Bianca De Luca, who was staging incoming shipments, witnessed the event and alerted Warehouse Supervisor Normand Vaillancourt. Investigation revealed that the pallet had been damaged during shipping—one corner post was cracked, reducing its structural integrity. Had Poirier accelerated sharply, taken a turn at speed, or encountered an obstacle, the pallet would likely have tipped from the forks, creating a crush hazard for personnel and potential chemical exposure from broken resin bags. The damaged pallet was immediately segregated and marked as unsafe. Receiving procedures were reviewed to identify how the damaged pallet passed initial inspection. Root cause was found to be incomplete damage assessment during the receiving check-in process due to shift transition time pressure.",2021-10-17 16:16:00,,132,EHS,NEAR_MISS

559,1001,"On November 14, 2024, at 14:45 during day shift operations, Injection Molding Line A experienced a catastrophic equipment failure in the primary hydraulic system. François Gagnon (EMP-00008), the line operator, was performing routine part removal when he noticed unusual noise from the hydraulic pump assembly. Within seconds, the pump seized completely, causing the mold clamping mechanism to lose pressure and fail to open properly. The 450-ton mold remained partially closed, trapping several finished parts inside. The equipment shutdown was immediate, but the malfunction revealed that critical preventive maintenance on the hydraulic fluid filtration system had been deferred for 8 weeks past its scheduled interval. Post-incident inspection by Maintenance Technician Fernand Giguère (EMP-00169) found that hydraulic fluid had become contaminated with micro-particles, accelerating pump wear. The line remained inoperative for 36 hours, impacting automotive component production schedules and delaying shipments to two major OEM customers. No personnel were directly injured, but the incident highlighted systemic maintenance scheduling failures.",2020-07-08 07:54:00,2020-07-09 19:54:00,126,DAMAGE,EQUIPMENT_FAILURE

While positioning a large aluminum container beneath the discharge chute, the container's rim caught on an protruding bolt from the hopper support structure. As Fernand attempted to reposition the container by pulling it forward, the regrind hopper's discharge valve suddenly opened partially due to a stuck linkage mechanism, causing approximately 40 kg of hot plastic granules (at 95°C) to discharge directly into the container. The sudden influx of material created pressure that caused the container to tip sideways. Fernand quickly stepped backward and laterally, narrowly avoiding contact with the spilled material, which scattered across the floor in a 2-meter radius. Had he maintained his original position, he would have sustained severe thermal burns and potential crush injuries from the falling container. Gilles Marchand (EMP-00087), the Facilities Maintenance Technician, witnessed the incident and immediately assisted with cleanup while Fernand reported the near-miss to his supervisor Normand Bergeron (EMP-00147).

Following standard troubleshooting procedures, he attempted to isolate the problem by manually moving the machine's hydraulic arm through its range of motion—a task normally requiring proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures. While moving the arm, Louis failed to verify that the energy isolation locks had been properly engaged. The press suddenly lurched forward as residual pressure in the hydraulic line was released through a micro-leak in a bypass valve, causing the machine's mold clamping mechanism to partially close. The mold moved approximately 8 centimeters toward the open position where Louis was standing, missing his left hand by an estimated 15-20 centimeters. Louis immediately released the manual control and the machine stabilized. Gilles Marchand (EMP-00087) heard the noise from his nearby workstation and arrived to find Louis visibly shaken but unharmed. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the LOTO checklist had been incomplete—three isolation points were not properly tagged, and the maintenance work order had not been verified against the energy isolation diagram before work began. This represents a significant systems failure in the safety management process for high-risk equipment operations during low-staffing night shift conditions.",2022-03-14 08:19:00,2022-03-14 09:04:00,139,EHS,NEAR_MISS

1335,1063,"On May 8, 2024, at 1:30 AM during the night shift, Material Handler Rashid Habib was transferring resin bags from the Material Drying and Preparation Room to a staging area near Injection Molding Line A. The facility had recently received a large shipment of polypropylene resin in 25-kilogram bags. As Habib was moving a pallet of resin bags using a hand truck, he inadvertently pulled the truck too close to a low-hanging flexible air duct that supplied heated, dry air to the material drying station. The edge of the pallet caught the air duct, partially dislodging it from its connection point. Rather than stopping to secure the duct properly, Habib continued moving the pallet and the duct became further disconnected, creating a significant gap at the connection. Within minutes, humid ambient air began entering the drying chamber, and the drying system's automatic controls initiated a heating cycle to compensate. However, because the duct connection was compromised, the heated air was being vented directly into the warehouse area instead of into the drying chamber. This created a localized high-temperature zone near the Material Drying room exit. Machine Setter Louis Desbiens, who was on break and walking through the area at 1:45 AM, felt the intense heat and immediately notified Night Shift Supervisor of the hazard. The situation was quickly corrected by reconnecting the duct and inspecting the drying system. A thermal imaging check confirmed that ambient air temperature in the affected zone had risen to approximately 48°C (118°F) for roughly 15 minutes.

1392,1168,"On March 28, 2024, at 09:30 hours during day shift operations, Workplace Hazard Assessment Specialist Zahra Nasri conducted a routine walkthrough inspection of the Finished Goods Warehouse (UNIT-008) and identified a significant ergonomic hazard affecting inventory control operations. Inventory Control Specialist Nicole Proulx has been performing manual pallet stacking operations for inventory repositioning, reaching heights between 4.5 and 6 feet repeatedly throughout her 8-hour shift without mechanical assistance. Observation of her working posture revealed sustained awkward back flexion, shoulder elevation, and lateral bending to perform product placement. Over a 3-week period, Nicole reported cumulative lower back discomfort and right shoulder strain but had not filed a formal incident report, instead managing symptoms with over-the-counter pain relief. Zahra interviewed Nicole and reviewed historical warehouse operations, discovering that the recently installed automated material handling system had been underutilized due to operator unfamiliarity and perceived inefficiency for smaller order fulfillment. Additionally, the warehouse lacks height-adjustable work platforms or mechanical lift assists suitable for the diverse product dimensions stored. Zahra classified this as a preventive declaration under the ISO 45001 implementation initiative to address ergonomic risks before acute injury occurs. The observation revealed systemic risk affecting all 15 warehouse personnel performing similar tasks.",2020-10-17 04:08:00,,133,EHS,PREVENTIVE_DECLARATION

Investigation revealed that a 55-gallon drum of flammable resin solvent (acetone-based, flash point -9°C) had developed a pinhole leak from corrosion of the drum wall. The solvent had been pooling beneath the rack for an estimated 4-6 hours, accumulating approximately 8 liters on the concrete floor. Dust accumulation from composite fiber manufacturing operations in adjacent areas, combined with the solvent vapors, had created a highly flammable atmosphere in the enclosed space. At 22:49 hours, an unknown ignition source (likely from static electricity during the movement of nearby metal equipment) ignited the vapor-solvent mixture, resulting in a flash fire. The fire spread rapidly across the solvent pool and up the storage rack, reaching the overhead pipe rack before facility sprinklers activated at 22:51 hours. The automatic fire suppression system successfully contained the fire within 3 minutes, but not before two secondary drums on the rack were compromised by heat, releasing additional solvent vapors. Claude Rioux (EMP-00185), Electrical Maintenance Lead, immediately activated the facility emergency evacuation alarm and assisted in evacuating all night shift personnel (approximately 18 workers). The local fire department arrived at 23:08 hours and confirmed the fire was completely extinguished by 23:14 hours. Damage assessment revealed approximately $48,000 in property damage including the original leaking drum, two secondary drums, storage rack damage, and thermal damage to overhead piping. The facility was evacuated for 6 hours during fire department investigation and ventilation procedures. No injuries occurred, but the incident prompted immediate facility-wide closure and comprehensive safety review. Simon Bélanger (EMP-00069) declared the incident as part of the emergency response team.",2024-05-31 09:17:00,2024-05-31 15:47:00,135,DAMAGE,FIRE

Production Engineer Sébastien Carrier was monitoring the industrial resin dryer unit (Model Wittmann Battenfeld WHP 800) when it suddenly began emitting an unusual grinding noise from the heating element motor. Within 90 seconds, the motor seized completely, causing the rotating drum to stop abruptly while still containing approximately 200 kilograms of polycarbonate resin at elevated temperature (220°C). The sudden stoppage created uneven cooling and thermally-induced stress on the drum's internal heating coils. The motor's bearing failure was caused by inadequate lubrication—maintenance records showed the bearing had not been re-greased in 18 months despite a manufacturer-recommended 12-month interval. When production crew attempted to manually rotate the drum to clear the material, they discovered the internal heating coil had cracked due to thermal stress, resulting in contamination of the polycarbonate batch. Estimated equipment damage: $34,000. Estimated material loss: $12,500. The dryer required shutdown for 72 hours pending coil replacement and motor rebuild.

The machine had been in operation for a 12-hour production run and was scheduled for mold changeover. Pascal initiated the Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) procedure and secured the energy isolation points; however, due to inadequate communication between shifts, the incoming night shift supervisor (Lucie Fillion, EMP-00151) was not immediately aware that the machine was locked out. While Pascal was accessing the interior of the mold cavity to remove residual plastic material, Lucie attempted to restart the machine from the remote control panel to check if the LOTO was functioning properly. The machine's hydraulic press cycled partially, causing the upper mold to descend approximately 3 inches before hydraulic pressure sensors detected the anomaly and triggered an automatic shutoff. Pascal's left hand was between the molds at the time. The safety interlock system prevented full compression, and the mold halted before causing severe injury. Pascal immediately felt pressure on his hand and called out; Lucie ceased operations. Lockout/Tagout Coordinator Gaétan Laplante (EMP-00161) arrived and verified proper LOTO procedures were in place. Upon inspection, Pascal sustained bruising and minor laceration to his left hand but no fractures. First aid was administered by Occupational Health Nurse Hana Al-Rashid.

The forklift's right tire had caught on an uneven floor transition, and Nicole was attempting to rock the vehicle free by repeatedly engaging forward and reverse gears without dismounting. O'Connor immediately approached and observed that Proulx was leaning out of the forklift seat without proper harness engagement, and her right arm was extended dangerously close to the gap between the forklift and the adjacent pallet stack. O'Connor shouted a warning and signaled Proulx to stop. Proulx immediately halted the maneuver. Upon inspection, O'Connor noted that the forklift seat belt had been deliberately routed behind the seat rather than across the operator, and the floor transition that caused the catch point had several raised edges creating a trip hazard. The warehouse maintenance log showed no recent repairs to that floor section. The near-miss was documented with photographs of the hazardous positioning and floor condition. No injuries occurred, but the potential for a crush injury from the forklift or pallet stack collapse was significant.",2019-04-12 22:48:00,,144,EHS,NEAR_MISS

The leak, estimated at approximately 3-4 gallons per hour, was pooling on the concrete floor beneath the oven's cooling water circulation system, creating both a slipping hazard and potential environmental contamination risk. The hydraulic fluid, a synthetic ISO VG 46 oil used in the oven's thermal regulation system, was beginning to migrate toward a floor drain connected to the facility's wastewater system. André immediately shut down the affected oven, cordoned off the leaking area with warning tape, and placed absorbent pads and a collection pan under the leak point to prevent further environmental release. He notified Safety Officer Anh Nguyen and Maintenance Engineer Sylvain Jodoin. The spill area was documented and photographed. A preliminary investigation indicated that a connection fitting on the cooling system had corroded and failed due to improper installation angle during the last maintenance cycle (8 months prior). Maintenance personnel determined the oven would require 48 hours of repairs. During this time, production was rerouted to the two functional ovens, causing a 12-hour production delay for one customer order. Environmental assessment confirmed that approximately 2.5 gallons had been released to the floor, and none had entered the wastewater system due to rapid containment efforts.",2018-03-08 11:36:00,2018-03-10 11:36:00,142,ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENTAL_INCIDENT

The fire originated near the plastic regrind processing area where waste plastic scraps are collected, sorted, and prepared for reprocessing. A combination of factors created a perfect storm: plastic dust had accumulated on horizontal surfaces and equipment over a three-week period due to inadequate housekeeping during extended overtime operations, the ambient temperature in the area had risen to 28°C (82°F) due to failing HVAC maintenance, and a spark was generated when a metal containment bin was inadvertently moved across the concrete floor by a forklift operator, creating friction. The dust ignited, and the fire rapidly spread through accumulated material. Although no personnel were directly in the immediate area, the fire consumed approximately 4,000 pounds of accumulated plastic scrap material, damaged two regrind processing machines (estimated loss $180,000), destroyed one containment bin system, and caused significant smoke damage to adjacent areas. The night shift supervisor on duty, operating under skeleton crew conditions, did not have adequate communication tools to rapidly coordinate evacuation and emergency response. The fire was extinguished by the on-site sprinkler system and contained by the facility's fire suppression systems within 22 minutes. Emergency services responded at 6:47 AM.

2203,1168,"On May 18, 2024, at 6:30 PM during evening shift operations in the Central Maintenance Workshop, Fernand Giguère (EMP-00169), Maintenance Technician, sustained a significant laceration and partial crush injury to his left hand while attempting to clear a blockage in the hydraulic oil filter assembly of a large 300-ton injection molding machine (Machine #18). Giguère was using a rubber mallet to dislodge a stubborn filter cartridge when the pressure relief valve suddenly released residual system pressure. The cartridge ejected forcefully, striking his left hand between the index and middle fingers. The impact caused the cartridge edge to lacerate the web of his hand and crush the soft tissue, resulting in significant bleeding. A co-worker, Tool Maker René Caron (EMP-00097), who was assisting with the maintenance task, immediately applied direct pressure with clean rags and assisted Giguère to the first aid station. The Respiratory Protection Program Coordinator, Jamal Thompson (EMP-00152), responded within 3 minutes and provided advanced first aid, bandaging the wound and elevating the hand. After 15 minutes of observation, it became clear that the injury required professional medical evaluation, and Giguère was transported to the nearby Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé in Laval by company vehicle, accompanied by Caron. Emergency department examination revealed a 4-centimeter laceration requiring 8 stitches, deep tissue bruising, and mild crush syndrome affecting soft tissue viability. The employee was hospitalized for overnight observation and discharged the following morning with a return-to-work restriction of modified duty for 10 days. Root cause analysis identified that the hydraulic system pressure had not been properly relieved before maintenance began; standard LOTO procedures were not fully followed, as the relief valve was depressed manually rather than using the designated pressure bleeding tool.",2021-01-02 00:17:00,2021-01-03 00:17:00,137,EHS,INJURY

While attempting to clear a resin blockage in the hopper feed system, his right hand became caught between the rotating auger screw and the fixed hopper wall. Despite having completed LOTO (Lockout/Tagout) training, Charbonneau had not fully de-energized the equipment before beginning maintenance—he had only paused the current cycle. When the system auto-cycled unexpectedly during his intervention, his hand was compressed, resulting in lacerations to his palm and fingers, a fractured metacarpal bone in his right hand, and partial avulsion of skin on his index finger. Quality Inspector Catherine Leblanc (EMP-00026) heard his cry for help and immediately activated emergency stop and called first aid. The employee was transported to the regional trauma center where he underwent emergency surgery and was hospitalized for 3 days. He was subsequently placed on light duty for 6 weeks during recovery.",2022-12-28 01:29:00,2022-12-31 01:29:00,128,EHS,LOST_TIME
2523,1084,"On May 8, 2024, at approximately 6:30 PM during the evening shift, chemical mixing operator Elena Popescu (EMP-00022) was transferring a large batch of epoxy resin catalyst from a 200-liter storage drum to smaller mixing containers in the Chemical Storage and Mixing facility. While disconnecting the transfer hose from the supply drum, the quick-disconnect coupling failed and a pressurized spray of catalyst solution discharged directly into her face and eyes. The chemical exposure caused immediate burning sensation and temporary vision impairment. Popescu rinsed her eyes at the emergency eyewash station for 15 minutes, but the irritation persisted. She reported the incident to her supervisor and was transported to the occupational health clinic where she was examined, treated with topical medication, and prescribed 48 hours of restricted work duty. Over the following weeks, she experienced residual eye irritation and sensitivity to light, resulting in 8 additional days of lost work time spread over a 4-week period as her condition improved. Root cause analysis identified that the coupling was 8 years old with visible wear, regular pressure testing had not been performed, and protective face shields were not consistently worn during chemical handling operations.",2024-08-16 22:20:00,2024-08-18 22:20:00,132,EHS,LOST_TIME
2525,1003,"On April 3, 2024, at 10:30 AM during the day shift, Production Operator Aisha Kamara (EMP-00072) was performing routine part removal and sorting tasks on Injection Molding Line B at the Automotive assembly station (UNIT-002). After completing her 4th consecutive hour of repetitive gripping and twisting motions to remove cooled plastic components from the mold, Aisha began experiencing acute sharp pain in her right wrist and forearm. She reported the symptoms to her line supervisor, Sonia Dasilva (EMP-00128), who immediately provided ice and offered first aid. The pain was consistent with acute repetitive strain syndrome affecting the extensor carpi radialis muscle group. Aisha completed her shift with modified duties focusing on lighter assembly tasks. She was sent to the on-site occupational health clinic where the injury was assessed and documented. Ibuprofen and a wrist compression wrap were provided, along with recommendations for rest and ergonomic modification of her workstation. The injury did not result in lost time but was recorded as a first aid case requiring medical evaluation and follow-up care over the next two weeks.",2018-02-21 00:45:00,2018-02-21 04:45:00,127,EHS,FIRST_AID
2526,1003,"On February 28, 2024, at 3:15 PM during the evening shift, Mold Technician Stéphane Moreau (EMP-00021) was performing routine mold maintenance and inspection in the Mold Manufacturing and Repair Shop (UNIT-013). While examining a composite injection mold for hairline fractures using visual inspection under standard fluorescent lighting, Stéphane noticed that the existing lighting in the work area has become increasingly inadequate over the past 3 months due to two failed fluorescent ballasts that had not been replaced. The poor lighting conditions have caused significant eye strain during detailed precision work, and Stéphane has been experiencing mild headaches and fatigue during his shifts. He documented this observation and reported it to Production Supervisor Lucie Fillion (EMP-00151) and EHS Coordinator Samira El-Khoury (EMP-00003) as a preventive hazard declaration before any injury occurred. The report noted that inadequate lighting in the tool room poses risks not only for vision fatigue and headaches but also increases the likelihood of missed defects in mold quality and potential eye strain-related errors. This preventive declaration was registered in the JHSC incident log and initiated a workplace hazard assessment to address the lighting deficiency.",2020-10-01 03:28:00,,138,EHS,PREVENTIVE_DECLARATION
2527,1123,"On November 14, 2024, at approximately 14:45 during day shift operations, a catastrophic equipment failure occurred in Injection Molding Line D. Machine operator Leila Farah was monitoring the injection cycle when a high-pressure hydraulic line coupling on the mold clamping mechanism suddenly failed, spraying pressurized hydraulic fluid across the work station. The fluid struck the adjacent control console and electrical junction box, causing an electrical short circuit and triggering a small fire in the cabinet. The operator quickly shut down the machine using the emergency stop button and activated the facility fire suppression system. Maintenance technician Fernand Giguère responded immediately with a portable fire extinguisher, extinguishing the small blaze within 90 seconds. The hydraulic fluid damaged approximately $47,000 worth of electrical components and control systems. The coupling failure was attributed to metal fatigue from inadequate preventive maintenance scheduling—the coupling had exceeded its manufacturer-recommended service interval by eight months. No personnel injuries occurred, but the incident resulted in 18 hours of production downtime.",2020-09-07 23:54:00,2020-09-08 17:54:00,129,DAMAGE,PROPERTY_DAMAGE
2528,1063,"On November 18, 2024, at approximately 22:15 during evening shift operations, a significant chemical spill incident occurred in the Chemical Storage and Mixing Room (UNIT-010). Machine setter Tomas Jimenez was transferring a 55-gallon drum of epoxy resin from a storage rack when the drum suddenly slipped from the handling straps and fell approximately 4 feet onto the concrete floor. The impact ruptured the drum, releasing approximately 35 gallons of epoxy resin mixed with hardener across the floor. The spill spread rapidly across 120 square feet of the chemical storage area, seeping toward floor drains and creating a slip hazard. Supervisor Lucie Fillion immediately evacuated personnel from the area, activated the ventilation system to maximum capacity, and notified the HSE team. Fumes from the hardener (containing methyl ethyl ketone) created poor air quality affecting a radius of approximately 30 feet. Alain Mercier from HSE response deployed absorbent materials and contained the spill within 25 minutes. The contaminated materials were placed in hazardous waste containers. The room required 4 hours of ventilation before re-entry was permitted. The incident resulted in a 2-hour production delay for composite materials processing in the adjacent area.",2018-10-17 03:45:00,2018-10-17 07:45:00,135,ENVIRONMENT,CHEMICAL_SPILL
2529,1123,"On November 21, 2024, at approximately 06:30 during night shift operations in the Regrind and Recycling Department (UNIT-018), material handler Salma Haddad sustained a significant back and shoulder injury while performing manual material handling tasks. Haddad was transferring rejected plastic parts from a quality control reject bin into a grinding hopper when she reached awkwardly to grasp a large batch of parts from the bottom of an overflowing bin. The bin was positioned at knee height without proper ergonomic accommodation, forcing Haddad to bend at the waist with a twisted spine. As she lifted approximately 18 kg of parts, she felt a sudden sharp pain in her lower left back and shoulder. She immediately stopped work and reported the injury to night shift supervisor on duty. The incident was assessed as a potential herniated disc with acute muscle strain. Haddad was transported to the occupational health clinic where imaging confirmed a Grade 2 lumbar strain with ligamentous injury. She was placed on modified duty for 6 weeks and prescribed physiotherapy. The incident was investigated by Brigitte Mathieu from the incident investigation team, revealing that the material handling station had not been evaluated for ergonomic compliance in over 18 months.",2024-10-12 13:48:00,,143,EHS,INJURY
